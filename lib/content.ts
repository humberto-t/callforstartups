  problem:
    "Global pork production emits over 800 Mt CO₂e annually and relies on soy feed that drives 40% of Amazon deforestation. Smallholder farmers in Southeast Asia, where 60% of global pork is consumed, lack access to feed alternatives that are both affordable and protein-dense.",
  solution:
    "We ferment agricultural side-streams using a proprietary Aspergillus strain (patent pending, EU application 23158972) to produce a protein ingredient with 62% crude protein content and 94% digestibility — benchmarked against fishmeal. Validated in two 8-week pig trials at SLU Uppsala with 8% better feed-conversion ratio. Current production cost is €1.40/kg at pilot scale; we hit price-parity with soy at 500-ton annual throughput.",
  framework:
    "Our ingredient displaces soy and fishmeal — two of the largest drivers of land-use change and ocean depletion flagged in EAT Lancet. By substituting 20% of European pig feed we would cut 18 Mt CO₂e and spare ~2.4M hectares of land annually, directly pulling two planetary-boundary indicators (biosphere integrity, land-system change) back toward safe operating space.",
